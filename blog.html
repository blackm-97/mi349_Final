                    <h3>Why Voices of The Void is a masterpiece</h3>

                    <span class="tab"></span><em>Voices of the Void</em> is an indie horror game that gives the player a role as a scientist confined to a research station somewhere in the mountains of Switzerland. You have been sent to process signals captured by the various satellite dishes that you manage, which also happen to be your only companions during your stay. As the days drag on, and tasks become routine, you start to wonder if the game is truly meant to be a horror game. However, when your guard starts to slip the game will slowly start to creep into the cracks. You might be fixing a relay at night to see eyes peering through the darkness, only to disappear once you turn to look at them. You might scan a signal that contains a message, warning you that something is approaching. You might arrive back at the base and find the breaker box hiss and kill the lights, only to investigate and discover something gone in and manually turned all the lights off. I had lied at the start when I said your only friends were the satellite dishes you manage. The truth is that there is always something in the shadows. No matter how monotonous the days can be, or how much you get used to the routine, there is never a moment when you feel truly alone. And if you manage to gather whatever courage that may be scattered across the dingy walls of the compound, and decide to seek out whatever ghosts seem to be haunting the mountains, you will regret ever trying to discover the answer. Curiosity may kill the cat, but I assure you that the punishment you receive will be worse.

                    <h3>How OneDrive caused me to lose my sanity</h3>

                    <span class="tab"></span>OneDrive is a cloud storage system created by Microsoft in order to store and protect files in case your physical computer is ever damaged. In theory, it works well and can help if your computer was every compromised. However, in practice it is more annoying than helpful. I have receieved multiple headaches because of this confusing piece of software, and I eventually uninstalled it completely from my PC. Even doing that carried its fair share of problems, but we will get to that momentarily. First of all, it only gives about 100GB of storage, which is a good amount but will fill up quickly for bigger computers. When you hit that limit, you will get constant notifications begging you to upgrade to a different plan. Another issue is that OneDrive actually does not actually make a copy of the files on your computer. Instead, it actually MOVES the files from your physical computer into the storage. This makes for a very confusing problem where many people will delete files from the storage to make more space, but not realizing that they are deleting those files forever. This happened to myself once, and afterwards I decided to delete it from my computer as it was getting very annoying. However, removing OneDrive became a huge chore. I had to redownload all my files from OneDrive back onto my PC, which took a very long time to complete. There is no easy 'remove OneDrive' button provided, so you need to manually download all the files from the cloud. Microsoft seriously dropped the ball on this, and it would be easily fixed if OneDrive simply copied the files instead of moving them into the cloud completely.
