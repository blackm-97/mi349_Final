                    <span class="tab"></span>This is a game made for Auto-Owners insurance to act as a Virtual Reality training program for claims associates. The goal of the game is to have associates learn where contruction materials are located within a household, and apply that knowledge by building a home inside of the game as well. The player will traverse a simulated home based off of real life households, and collect relevant materials from each room. The game runs on a Meta Quest 3 VR headset, so it can be played anywhere as long as you have the hardware for it. It uses the Unity game engine, and uses assets from the Unity Asset Store. The game was made with a team of 6 people, including myself, as a CSE Capstone project. We worked with Auto-Owners over the course of a semester in order to make sure the game was satisfactory. You can use the green play button to go to the project website, and get more info about it.

                    <span class="tab"></span>MINOTAUR is a psychological horror game where the monster is the house youre living in. The halls will contort and bend as you walk through them, leading only deeper into the impossible architecture of the abode. It was made over the course of 4 months, and runs on the Roblox game engine. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to complete, and has 3 different endings. It is probably the most technically impressive game that I have made by myself, and has a lot of gameplay features that I had to make from scratch. One of which is seamless teleporting that sells the non-eauclidian aspect; it allows for the setting to change without the player noticing. Please check it out if you have the time!

The main goal is to travel through the different areas and find hidden keys that will unlock the ending. Despite being the least technical of all the games, it has garnered the most amount of visits of any game at 65,000 visits. It was made in about 3 months, and runs on the Roblox game engine. It was the first video game I ever made, but despite that seems to be doing rather well. Use the green play button in the corner to check it out!
