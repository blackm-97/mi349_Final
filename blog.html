                    <h3>Why Voices of The Void is a masterpiece</h3>

                    <span class="tab"></span><em>Voices of the Void</em> is an indie horror game that gives the player a role as a scientist confined to a research station somewhere in the mountains of Switzerland. You have been sent to process signals captured by the various satellite dishes that you manage, which also happen to be your only companions during your stay. As the days drag on, and tasks become routine, you start to wonder if the game is truly meant to be a horror game. However, when your guard starts to slip the game will slowly start to creep into the cracks. You might be fixing a relay at night to see eyes peering through the darkness, only to disappear once you turn to look at them. You might scan a signal that contains a message, warning you that something is approaching. You might arrive back at the base and find the breaker box hiss and kill the lights, only to investigate and discover something gone in and manually turned all the lights off. I had lied at the start when I said your only friends were the satellite dishes you manage. The truth is that there is always something in the shadows. No matter how monotonous the days can be, or how much you get used to the routine, there is never a moment when you feel truly alone. And if you manage to gather whatever courage that may be scattered across the dingy walls of the compound, and decide to seek out whatever ghosts seem to be haunting the mountains, you will regret ever trying to discover the answer. Curiosity may kill the cat, but I assure you that the punishment you receive will be worse.
